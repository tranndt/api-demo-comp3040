# Manitoba Population API
We are offering a basic API which will provide polulations of towns and cities in Manitoba for a given **area** and **time period**.

Our API works with a simple **GET** request to https://api.mbpopulation.org/json.

### Parameters

* **Year** (integer) - Year in ```YYYY``` format. Required.
* **Month** (integer) - Month in ```MM``` format. If not present, month will default to ```"01"``` (January). Optional.

### Resources
